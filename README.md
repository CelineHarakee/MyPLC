# MyPLC
MyPLC is a conceptual, intelligent application designed to enhance the security and efficiency of Powerline Communication (PLC) networks using Artificial Intelligence. It focuses on early detection of cyber intrusions, optimized network performance, and real-time alerting for both users and administrators.
This application is not a published or deployed product but rather a comprehensive design and system prototype, including full documentation, UI/UX mockups, UML diagrams, and engineering artifacts. It simulates a real-world, production-ready system and showcases the application of AI in network security within PLC environments.
